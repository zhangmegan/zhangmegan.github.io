*What are you thinking about?*

I tend to be pretty quiet (especially around people I'm not very familiar with), and I think that this quietness is often mistaken for thoughtfulness. So many times I have been asked the dreaded quesion, *what are you thinking about?*, as if I must have been pondering something deeply philosophical (or academic, or intellectual, not that the three are mutually exclusive) in my silence. When I am asked this question I usually give myself two choices: either make something up in response, usually related to whatever the conversation was previously about. Or, tell the truth: "nothing, really". I almost always opt for the first because the second elicits a sort of disbelieving, almost offended reaction. 

But is it so strange that I could actually, truly, be thinking about nothing? (To qualify, I'm usually not thinking *nothing*, per say -- the brain doesn't really stop thinking. I suppose what I mean are things that don't require conscious thought -- so probably  profoundly uninteresting, "the table is brown"-type thoughts). I think it's okay to not have your mind *on* all the time. We don't need to have perfectly formulated stances on every pressing issue of today.
